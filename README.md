# gesture-multimedia
Using mediapipe to recognize gestures and control the computer's multimedia keys. \n



### NOTE: 
OS: EndeavourOS 6.8.2 (Linux)  \n
If you are on Linux, you might need to give admin permissions to run the code due to a library.\n
In addition, I cannot guarentee your keycode for the multimedia controls are the same as mine. \n
This has not been tested on Windows or MacOS. \n
This coul definitely be better. \n \n \n \n 


Stay safe and happy out there. \n \n \n \n


## Issues known: 
Model might just stop detecting gestures for awhile. \n
Program has no real method to delay input key being sent without possibly affecting gesture detection.\n
Dataset is not the best for this task; You should probably make your own dataset (with MediaPipe Hand Landmarks Detection).\n
It just messy. \n \n \n \n \n
